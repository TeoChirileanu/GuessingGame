    <description><![CDATA[
			<p>The <b>:any-link</b> pseudo-class represents an element that acts as the source anchor of a hyperlink.
				For example, in HTML5, any &lt;a&gt;, &lt;area&gt;, or &lt;link&gt; elements with an href attribute are hyperlinks, and thus match
				:any-link.
				It matches an element if the element would match :link or :visited, equivalent to :matches(:link, :visited).</p>
